# Quickstart Guide for Developers

Welcome to Fluctux! Follow these simple steps to get started with the project. By the end of this guide, you will have a local environment set up and be ready to start writing code.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker:** [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **pnpm:** [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

If you do not have pnpm installed, follow the instructions below:

### Installing pnpm
1. First, install Node.js (if it's not already installed). You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. To install pnpm, you can use npm (which comes with Node.js). Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```shell
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
3. After installation, verify that pnpm is installed correctly by checking its version:
    ```shell
    pnpm -v
    ```

## Steps to Get Started
1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the project from GitHub by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/gitmahin/fluctux.git
    ```
    Change into the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd fluctux
    ```
2. **Start the Project with Docker**

    Once inside the project directory, use Docker to set up the necessary environment. Run the following command:
    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    This will automatically build and start all the necessary containers, including the backend and frontend environments, allowing you to get started with development immediately.

3. **Install Dependencies with pnpm**

    After the Docker containers are up and running, you'll need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command to install the required packages:
    ```shell
    pnpm install
    ```
    This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.


## You're Ready to Start!
Now that everything is set up, you can start writing code! To contribute to the project, simply make changes to the files, and Docker will handle the rest.

Let’s start coding! Happy hacking! ✨
