# Local Setup

Welcome to Fluctux! Follow these simple steps to get started with the project. By the end of this guide, you will have a local environment set up and be ready to start writing code.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker:** [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **pnpm:** [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- **turbo:** [Install turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/installation)

If you don't have pnpm installed, follow the instructions below:

### 1. Installing `pnpm` Globally
1. First, install Node.js (if it's not already installed). You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. To install pnpm, you can use npm (which comes with Node.js). Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```shell
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
3. After installation, verify that pnpm is installed correctly by checking its version:
    ```shell
    pnpm -v
    ```
### 2. Also Download `turbo` Globally
```
npm install -g turbo
```

## Steps to Get Started
1. **Fork & Clone the Repository**

    First, fork the repository from [TeamFluctux](https://github.com/teamfluctux/fluctux) and clone by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/fluctux.git
    ```
    Change into the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd fluctux
    ```
    Run the following command to install the project dependencies
    ```
    pnpm i
    ```

2. **Start the Project with Docker**

    Once inside the project directory, use Docker to set up the necessary environment. Run the following command:
    ```shell
    docker compose watch
    ```
    This will automatically build and start all the necessary containers.

    or,
    ```
    pnpm run dev
    ```

## You're Ready to Start!
Now that everything is set up, you can start writing code! To contribute to the project, simply make changes to the files, and Docker will handle the rest.

Let’s start coding! Happy hacking! ✨
